New Rule "Fire&Movement":
Every Unit may performe a combind "Fire & Move"-Action.
The rule must be simple and mainstream. Here it is:
1. The Action Cost is equal to the Attack Cost.
2. The Fire Power in always lowers by -2.
3. The Range and any Fire-Power-Bonus is determined from the
starting Hex.
Example 1: A russian SMG-Rifle is 2 Hex away. They perform a
"Fire&Move"-Action to get closer. The Action Cost is 3,
the red FP is lowers from 4 to 2.
Example 2: If the same Units starts the "Fire&Move"-Action to get from
a adjacent Hex in Close Combat, than count the Short Range
Bonus, because this is the starting hex. And not the CC-Bonus.
In this case the red FP is 4 - 2 + 3 = 5.
