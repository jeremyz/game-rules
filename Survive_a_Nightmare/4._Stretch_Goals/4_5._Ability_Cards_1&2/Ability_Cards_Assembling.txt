1.-The PDF file of the ability cards is designed to be printed on one sheet of paper on both sides, on one side print the front of the cards and on the other side the backs.

* If you prefer you can print the front and back of the ability cards in separate sheets of paper, and after cutting them, glue each front card with a back, this will give you a greater thickness on each card.
