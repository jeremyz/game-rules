trying to summarize 6.7.1:
the observer must have LOS to a valid target.
Observer may be FO/HQ/Staff/Plt HQ depending on the mission.
If FO is the observer, he must be issued an order by HQ or staff via CO net or direct communication ... then he must be able to communication back to the firing agency using FD Net (needs phone lines or be adjacent to the staging area).
If an HQ or Plt HQ is the eligible observer, communication is made with the firing agency via the BN net, (relayed for free through the CO HQ if a Plt HQ is the observer).
The cost is always a single action.
