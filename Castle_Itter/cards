defender defense value is always location value, there is no defense value for Defenders


Place Sturm, Scout, Rifleman
    - N * RESOLVE
    2d6 -> Entry point
    - ASK SUPPRESS
    before each Entry point resolution -> use suppress token -> nd6 >= defense -> destroyed
    -> move SS tokens forward

Place Mg and Mortar
    - N * RESOLVE
    2d6 -> Entry point
    - ASK SUPPRESS
    before each Entry point resolution -> use suppress token -> nd6 >= defense -> destroyed
    chose a target within the same color -> 1d6 -> higher or lower to find target
    if target is found -> nd6 (3/4) >= location defense > disrupt target

Attack location : Pak 40 x 2, Flak 37, Panzerfaust
    1d6 -> location (always BesottenJenny for the Panzerfaust)
    - RESOLVE
    nd6 -> at least 1d >= location defense -> reduce location defense
    if defense already at minimum, each defender is disrupted
    if Besotten Jenny reaches 0 -> destroyed -> defenders becom casualties -> no more usage -> no more attacks

Flak 30
    1d6 -> color -> each defender 2d6 >=  location defense -> disrupt

Attack defender : Sniper:
